With Java 11, now HttpClient is a standard. It is recommended to use instead of other HTTP Client APIs like Apache Http Client API. 
It is quite feature rich and now Java based applications can make 
HTTP requests without using any external dependency.

Following are the steps to use an HttpClient.
	1.Create HttpClient instance using HttpClient.newBuilder() instance

	2.Create HttpRequest instance using HttpRequest.newBuilder() instance

	3.Make a request using httpClient.send() and get a response object.
