Java 11 introduced a concept of nested class where we can declare a class within a class. This nesting of classes allows to 
logically group the classes to be used in one place, making them more readable and maintainable. 

Nested class can be of four types âˆ’
	1.Static nested classes
	2.Non-static nested classes
	3.Local classes
	4.Anonymous classes

Java 11 also provide the concept of nestmate to allow communication and verification of nested classes.
